Description: This collection of R functions can be used to support projects
  of international development cooperation in planning and evaluating 
  projects in the forest sector. It helps to understand dynamics of 
  deforestation globally by using Global Forest Watch data sets and 
  user specified areas of interest. The packages provides a common 
  interface to derive reproducible statistics on deforestation and
  fragmentation indicators with a convenient user interface. The 
  development of the package was financed by the KFW Development Bank 
  and realised by MapTailor Geospatial Consulting GbR.
